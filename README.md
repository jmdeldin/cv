# XeLaTeX CV/Résumé Template

This is an XeLaTeX template optimized for Mac OS X, but it should work on any
machine with XeLaTeX and appropriate fonts. If you use this, please make
yours look unique -- I don't want to change my design! And further, let
me know if you get a job with this CV!

## Usage

1. Place `xecv.cls` in the same directory as your CV
2. Use `\documentclass{xecv}` (see example.tex and below for details)
3. Compile with `xelatex MY_TEX_FILE`
